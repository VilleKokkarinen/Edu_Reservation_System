### Currently aware of the following "problems", or "faults"

- Cancelling reservations is under progress
- Language setting does not change the language ( Stuck on Finnish )
- Dates are formatted as (DD/MM/YYYY) and there is no way to change this.

- Dates found in date time pickers, are only availabe with Finnish names
